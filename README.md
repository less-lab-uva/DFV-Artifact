[[Paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9678590)] [[Appendix](https://felipetoledo4815.github.io/files/publications/ASE21-DFV-Appendix.pdf)] [[Video-presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjmZEl8Ipc)]

This is the artifact to accompany the ASE technical track submission "Distribution Models for Falsification and Verification of DNNs".

The artifact is split into several directories.

- Directory `rq1` contains the code and data from our experiments for research question 1. The environment models used to evaluate DFV, verifiers and falsifiers outputs, and processed data can be downloaded by running `python download.py` from within the `rq1` directory.

- Directory `rq2` contains the code and data from our experiments for research question 2. The environment models used to evaluate DFV, falsifiers outputs, and processed data can be downloaded by running `python download.py` from within the `rq2` directory.

- Directory `rq3` contains the code and data from our experiments for research question 3. The environment models used to evaluate DFV are available in the `RQ3 Models` directory at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1E1-keCoZ8bvKFkud_jofXtYApKT-nTJz. The models and data trained to use the models can be downloaded by running `python download.py` from within the `rq3` directory.

**The instructions to reproduce our experiments are in the INSTALL.md file under the 'Reproducing the study' section.**

# Further details
## RQ1

This directory contains the code to replicate the evaluation of our first research question.

### Models
Use `train_vae.py` to train the Fashion MNIST network and VAE. Use `train_vae_mrs.py` to train the VAE MRS. Models will be output to the directory `./saved_models/`.

### Verifiers
Use `verify.sh` to verify all the properties on the Fashion MNIST network with and without DFV. By default the script will run all the tools used in the experiment. However a specific tool can be specified by passing `neurify`, `nnenum`, `verinet` as the first argument. Logs and counter-examples will be output to the directory `./output/Verifiers/`.

### Falsifiers
Use `falsify.sh` to falsify all the properties on the Fashion MNIST network with and without DFV. By default the script will run all the tools used in the experiment. However a specific tool can be specified by passing `deepfool`, `bim`, `fgsm`, `pgd` as the first argument. Logs and counter-examples will be output to the directory `./output/Falsifiers/`.


### Process data
The data generated by `verify.sh` in `./output/Verifiers` and `falsify.sh` in `./output/Falsifiers` need to be processed. To do so, run `process_data.py`. The processed data will be output to the directory `./processed_data/`.

### Print study graphs
The images used for the paper can be generated by running `print_images.py`. Images will be output to the directory `./images/`.

### Download Our Data
Running all the above scripts can be time-consuming, therefore by running `download.py` three folders will be downloaded `processed_data`, `saved_models` and `output`. These folders contain all the data needed to execute `print_images.py` without running the other scripts.

### Folder Description
#### Default
- `./common` contains files needed to run the `verify.sh`, `falsify.sh` and `process_data.py`.
- `./images` contains the png images generated for the paper.
- `./properties` contains the properties used for the verification and falsification of our model with and without DFV.
#### Generated
- `./data` will be created when running `train_vae.py` or `train_vae_mrs.py` to store MNIST Fashion dataset.
- `./saved_models` will be created when running `train_vae.py` or `train_vae_mrs.py` to store the state dictionaries of the models.
- `./output` will be created when running `verify.sh` or `falsify.sh` to store the results.
- `./processed_data` will be created when running `process_data.py` to store the calculations made on the obtained data.

## RQ2

This directory contains the code to replicate the evaluation of our second research question.
### Models
Use `train_models.py` to train the 90 Fashion MNIST VAEs. Use `train_vae_mrs.py` to train the VAE MRS. Models will be output to the directory `./saved_models/`.

### Falsifier - PGD
Use `falsify_multidim.sh` to falsify all the properties on the 90 Fashion MNIST models with DFV. Use `falsify_ls.sh` to falsify all the properties on the Fashion MNIST DFV 8-2-256 model, varying the radius of the latent space. Logs and counter-examples from `falsify_multidim.sh` will be output to the directory `./output/multidim_study/`, and the results from `falsify_ls.sh` will be output to the directory `./output/ls_study/`.

### Process data
The data generated by `falsify_multidim.sh` and `falsify_ls.sh` need to be processed. To do so, run `process_data.py`. The processed data will be output to the directory `./processed_data/`.

### Print study graphs
The images used for the paper can be generated by running `print_images.py`. Images will be output to the directory `./images/`.

### Download Our Data
Running all the above scripts can be time-consuming, therefore by running `download.py` three folders will be downloaded `processed_data`, `saved_models` and `output`. These folders contain all the data needed to execute `print_images.py` without running the other scripts.

### Folder Description
#### Default
- `./common` contains files needed to run the `falsify_multidim.sh`, `falsify_ls.sh` and `process_data.py`.
- `./images` contains the png images generated for the paper.
- `./properties/multidim_study` contains the properties used for the falsification of the 90 DFV models.
- `./properties/ls_study` contains the properties used for variating the latent space radius of DFV 8-2-256 model.
#### Generated
- `./data` will be created when running `train_models.py` or `train_vae_mrs.py` to store MNIST Fashion dataset.
- `./saved_models` will be created when running `train_models.py` or `train_vae_mrs.py` to store the state dictionaries of the models.
- `./output` will be created when running `falsify_multidim.sh` or `falsify_ls.sh` to store the results.
- `./processed_data` will be created when running `process_data.py` to store the calculations made on the obtained data.

## RQ3

This directory contains the code to replicate the evaluation of our third research question.

### Models
To train environment models, first download the pre-processed DroNet dataset by running `python download_data.py`.
Environment models can be trained by running `./train_fc.py` to train FC-*VAE_{DroNet}*, `./train_vae.py` to train Conv-*VAE_{DroNet}*, and `./train_dcgan.py` to train *GAN_{DroNet}*. Models will be output to the directory `./models/`.

### Running the Falsifier
The PGD falsifier can then be run on the DroNet network, both without DFV and with DFV using the VAE and GAN models by running `./falsify.sh`. By default this script will run all 3 methods. A specific treatment can be specified by passing `dnn`, `vae`, or `gan` as the first argument to this script. If the first argument is `all` then all treatments will be run. This script will save all counter-examples to the directory `cex/`. The second argument to `./falsify.sh` can be used to specify a different name for this directory. The third argument accepted by this script specifies a timeout for each job in seconds. By default this timeout is 1 hour, or 3600 seconds. The fourth argument specifies where to save the logs, by default this is the directory `logs/falsification_logs`.

### Processing the Data
After running the falsifier, counter-examples can be converted to png formatted images and the plots for the paper can be generated by running `python npy_to_png.py cex logs/falsification_logs`, where `cex` is the directory containing the counter-examples and `logs/falsification_logs` is the directory containing the logs from running `falsify.sh`. This script will convert all counter-examples from the numpy `.npy` format to PNG images, will create CSV files containing the times and MRS values for each counter-example, and generate the plots shown in the paper.

### Downloading Our Data
Running all of the above scripts can be time-consuming. We provide a script `download.py` to download our data to allow you to start from any stage of this process. This script will download our trained environment models and logs from running the falsifiers.

### Folder Description
#### Default
- `./benchmark` contains the GHPR-DroNet benchmark. Within this directory, `onnx/` contains the DroNet model, `properties/` contains the standard GHPR-DroNet properties, and `vae_properties/` contains the properties modified to accept an environment model prefix.
- `./cex` contains the counter-examples found, with the sub-directory `npy/` containing counter-examples in `.npy` format, and `png/` containing the counter-examples in `.png` format.
#### Generated
- `./models` will be created when running any of the training scripts (or downloading the models).
- `./logs/falsification_logs` will be created when running `falsify.sh`.
- `./Data` will be created when running `python download_data.py`, and contains the pre-processed DroNet dataset.
